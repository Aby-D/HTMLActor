   Sethupathi did a series of odd jobs for pocket money: salesman at a retail store, cashier at a fast food joint and a phone booth operator.[10] He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the Dhanraj Baid Jain College (an affiliate of the University of Madras) in Thoraipakam.[11] A week after he finished college, he joined as an account assistant at a wholesale cement business.[10] He had to take care of three siblings and moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates as an accountant because it paid him four times what he was earning in India. While in Dubai, he met his future-wife, Jessie, online. The two dated, eventually marrying in 2003.[10]
